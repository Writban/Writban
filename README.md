# Hi, I'm Writban

I build small, practical projects in **Python**, **C++**, and **web (HTML/CSS/JS)** â€” with a tilt toward **cybersecurity** and **web apps**.

## Featured projects
- Attack Tree Assistant (HTML, CSS, JS, Python): Helps design attack trees with suggestions on node addition and pruning, and provides descriptions for nodes present
- Port Scanner (Python): scans a host for open TCP ports.
- Password Generator (C++): creates strong passwords and checks strength.
- Portfolio Website: minimal, responsive personal site.
- To-Do App (JS): simple client-side app with localStorage.

## What Iâ€™m focusing on
- Clean, well-structured repos
- Small tests + simple CI
- Clear READMEs and live demos (GitHub Pages)
